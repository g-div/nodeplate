## What's included ?

- **Babel transpiling** ```npm start``` (using [babel](https://babeljs.io/))

  Write your code in [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

- **Watch files and reload** ```npm run dev``` (using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon))

  Run your script and watch for changes.

- **Debugging** ```npm run debug``` (using [babel-node-debug](https://github.com/crabdude/babel-node-debug))

  Debug your application using a babel-compatible version of [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector).

- **Test runner** ```npm test``` (using [lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab))

  Write your tests in the ```test``` folder and run them with ```npm test```.

- **Code coverage** ```npm run coverage``` (using [lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab))

  Lab can also calculate the code coverage.

- **Code linting** ```npm run lint``` (using [xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo))

  Lint your code (even **ES6/7** and **JSX**).

- **Code format** ```npm run format``` (using [xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo))

  Beautify and format you code. Fix errors found by **xo**

- **Recognize duplicate code** ```npm run inspect``` (using [jsinspect](https://github.com/danielstjules/jsinspect))

  Recognize duplicate, copy-pasted and similar code.

- **License checker** ```npm run licenses``` (using [license-checker](https://github.com/davglass/license-checker))

  Print the link and the license type of each dependency

- **Package building** ```npm run build``` (using [nar](https://github.com/h2non/nar))

  You can build an executable file out of your project including all dependencies.

  Please refer to *nar*'s documentation if you like to include a custom *node.js* version or to build a package for a different system-architecture/OS. You should simple edit the ```build```property in the ```scripts``` section of ```package.json``` to something like:
```sh    
    nar create --executable --os darwin --arch x64 --node 0.12.0
```

- **Find vulnerabilities** ```npm run deps:sec``` (using [nsp](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp))

  *nsp* (*Node Security Project*) will check if any dependency is affected by a known vulnerability.

- **Keep dependencies up-to-date** ```npm run deps:updates``` (using [david](https://github.com/alanshaw/david))

  David keeps dependencies up-to-date and will help you to [update](https://github.com/alanshaw/david#update-to-latest) them.

- **README generator** ```npm run readme``` (using [node-readme](https://github.com/revolunet/node-readme))

    Generate a README like this from an ES6 template extracting data from ```package.json```.
    Edit the ```.README.md``` template and run the command. Check the [node-readme documentation](https://github.com/revolunet/node-readme#custom-template) for all available variables/functions.

    **Do not edit the ```README.md```** in your project folder, since this will be **overwritten** running the ```npm run readme``` command.

- **Git hooks** (using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky))

  Custom ```precommit``` and ```prepush``` are defined in order to run tests (and vulnerabilities discovery) on commit and push. You can define your own in the ```package.json```


- **[npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all)**

## Install

```sh
git clone ${pkg.repository}
cd ${pkg.name}
npm install
```

## Usage
Use ```npm``` commands listed above as following:
```sh
npm run lint
npm run test:deps
```

or use [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all):

## TODOs:
- [ ] Documentation tool (JSDoc, dox, ...)
- [ ] Aggregate commands using npm-run-all
- [ ] Use a scaffolding system (init)
- [x] Consider [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) instead of **xo**
- [ ] Fix **nar**: should be able to use $npm_package_main variable (see [h2non/nar#115](https://github.com/h2non/nar/issues/115) and [h2non/nar#116](https://github.com/h2non/nar/issues/116))
- [ ] Consider [strong-build](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-build) instead of **nar**
- [ ] Consider [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
- [ ] Consider [hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel) and [minihost](https://github.com/typicode/minihost)
